* A bulletted list
- alternative syntax 1
+ alternative syntax 2
  - an indented list item

1. An
2. ordered
3. list

Inline markup styles: 

- _italics_
- **bold**
- `code()` 
 
> Blockquote
>> Nested Blockquote 
 
Syntax highlighting can be used by wrapping your code in a liquid tag like so:

{% highlight python %}
### Q1
print("{0} Q1 {0}".format('='*6))

from random import randint

print("You are a woodcutter.")
print("Let's cut the tree.")

BearTime = randint(1, 10)
for i in range(1, BearTime+1):
    print("You cut the tree %d times." % i)

print("You met a bear!!")
print("Run away?(1) or Fight?(2)")

choice = input()
print("You choose '%s'." % choice)

if choice == '1':
    print("Run away!!!")

    more = 1
    while more <= 3:
        print('more ' * more + 'faster!')
        more += 1

    survive = randint(0, 1)
    print("Yeah~ you are safe now! ^^" if survive
          else "You were caught by a bear;;;")
    
else:
    print("Not supported")

### Q2
print("\n{0} Q2 {0}".format('='*6))

import time
from random import randint

print("You are a woodcutter.")
print("Let's cut the tree.")

BearTime = randint(1, 10)
for i in range(1, BearTime+1):
    print("You cut the tree %d times." % i)

print("You met a bear!!")
print("Run away?(1) or Fight?(2)")

choice = input()
print("You choose '%s'." % choice)

if choice == '1':
    print("Run away!!!")

    more = 1
    while more <= 3:
        print('more ' * more + 'faster!')
        more += 1

    survive = randint(0, 1)
    print("Yeah~ you are safe now! ^^" if survive
          else "You were caught by a bear;;;")
    
elif choice == '2':
    print("You must defeat the bear in 6 attacks.\n" \
          "Bear's initial HP is 100.")
    
    HP = 100
    n = 1
    while n <= 6:
        attack = randint(1, 30)
        HP -= attack
        if HP < 0: HP = 0
        time.sleep(1)
        print("You have reduced the bear's health by %d in the attack." % attack)
        print("The remaining bear's health is %d." % HP)
        if HP == 0: break
        n += 1

    if HP > 0:
        print("Defeat! Even now, bear to bear!!")
    else:
        print("Victory! You got a bear leather!!")
        
else:
    print("Wrong input!")
{% endhighlight %}

creates...

{% highlight javascript %}
/* Some pointless Javascript */
var rawr = ["r", "a", "w", "r"];
{% endhighlight %}
 
Use two trailing spaces  
on the right  
to create linebreak tags  
 
Finally, horizontal lines
